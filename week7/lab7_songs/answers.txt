If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I'd say it has a good balance between energetic and calm songs, as well as a balanced valence on the music mood. However, I'd say it tends to like danceable songs more than other ones.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Because people tend to vary on their music listening preferences, and assuming that the top 100 songs do not contemplate how many times a songs has been listened, I'd propose to calculate the aura giving each song a weight on the final result, priorizing top results.
