Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
The lowest probability of winning changed a lot after running certain simulations. Specially the following:

France: 2.0% chance of winning
England: 2.0% chance of winning
Sweden: 1.0% chance of winning
Colombia: 1.0% chance of winning
Uruguay: 1.0% chance of winning

Changed to:
France: 3.4% chance of winning
England: 2.8% chance of winning
Sweden: 0.5% chance of winning
Colombia: 1.6% chance of winning
Uruguay: 0.5% chance of winning

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
After 100000 simulations there is enough data to get an accurate prediction.
