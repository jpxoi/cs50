# CS50
The CS50 repository contains all the code that was written during the Harvard CS50 course, excluding the final project. The code covers various topics such as programming fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, web development, databases, and more.

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to each week of the course. Within each week's directory, there are subdirectories for each individual problem set, containing the code for each problem set.

The code is written in various programming languages, including C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each file is well-documented and includes comments that explain the code's functionality, as well as any issues or limitations.

The repository also includes a PDF file with all the notes made during the lectures, which can be downloaded from the notes folder

The CS50 repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning computer science and programming, as it provides an extensive collection of high-quality code examples, demonstrating the concepts covered in the course. It can also be used as a reference for those looking to refresh their memory on particular topics or programming languages.
