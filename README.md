# CS50

The CS50 repository contains all the code that was written during the Harvard CS50 2023 course, excluding the final project. The code covers various topics such as programming fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, web development, databases, and more.

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to each week of the course. Within each week's directory, there are subdirectories for each individual problem set, containing the code for each problem set.

The code is written in various programming languages, including C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each file is well-documented and includes comments that explain the code's functionality, as well as any issues or limitations. The repository also includes a PDF file with all the notes made during the lectures, which can be downloaded from the notes folder

The CS50 repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning computer science and programming, as it provides an extensive collection of high-quality code examples, demonstrating the concepts covered in the course. It can also be used as a reference for those looking to refresh their memory on particular topics or programming languages.

## Structure

The structure is a hierarchical representation of a course curriculum, where each "Week" represents a week in the course and each week contains a "Lab" programming assignment, "Practice Problems" for additional practice, and a "Problem Set" for graded assessments.

## About CS50

CS50 is Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming, for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. (Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before.) This course teaches you how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. More than teach you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today’s newer languages, via which you’ll learn not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all. The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you’ll understand all the more because of C. Toward term’s end, the course introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which you can create web and mobile apps alike. Course culminates in a final project.

## How to Take this Course

Even if you are not a student at Harvard, you are welcome to “take” this course for free via this OpenCourseWare by working your way through the course’s eleven [weeks](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/) of material.
